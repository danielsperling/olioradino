  <h1> Our Philosophy </h1>

  <p>
    The Dora Radino properties are situated on the rolling hills of the Basilicata region.
    The volcanic soil lends itself particularly well for the farming of olive trees and grapes.
    The Dora Radino family has always been at the fore front in the production of premium quality organic olive oil and wine.
    When Mrs Dora Radino decided to take over the direct management of the family farmland in the 1980s, the aim she had in mind was to enrich traditional approaches to quality by introducing organic techniques.
    <em> "We are above all farmers, bound to our soil, our plants and the people who grow them and look after them" </em>
    A few years ago we started retailing our organic olive oil and our wine ourselves as we wanted to offer a reasonably-priced top-quality product that is traceable from tree to table under the control of our own farm

<!--  <h4>The specific structure of the volcanic soil and the quality of our organic olives confer to the cold pressed extra virgin oil produced by Azienda Agricola Dora Radino an intense green-tinged golden colour and a slightly bitter, spicy taste, with a touch of fruity sThweetness and a hint of almonds.
   These tasting features, enhanced by our oilâ€™s excellent anti-oxidant qualities, combine to produce a harmonious full-bodied oil that perfectly matches the simple dishes of everyday cuisine. Olive oil consists primarily of unsaturated vegetable fats (triacylglycerols) and other secondary ingredients such as vitamin E, squalene and b-carotene.
   All these substances, which are the basis of the Mediterranean diet, have antioxidant properties and are beneficial to health only if the level of free fatty acid content (acidity) is very low.</h4>

   <h4>Current European Union legislation requires extra virgin olive oil (the best quality) to have an acidity level of no more than 0.8%.
   The special know-how handed down by farming traditions in Basilicata and rigorous techniques for harvesting and processing the olives mean that we can obtain an extra virgin olive oil with an acidity level well below the legal limit (our organic oil never exceeds an acidity level of 0.3 %) and a minimal peroxide content. We produce high-quality oil because:
   We use exclusively olives from our own olive trees;</h4>

Rapolla, the town outside which our farm is located, lies at the foot of Monte Vulture in Potenza Province in the hilly area (circa 400 m.) of Basilicata. Monte Vulture is a long-extinct volcano which gave birth to the hills it still dominates and gives its name to our area of Vulture which is so rich in mineral waters and so famous for its naturally-fertile soil that it enjoys a designation of origin.
Olives and vines are the major farming activities here and symbolise the traditions of farming in this area with its rich historical and culture traditions. </h4>
<h4>Visit the mediaeval city of Melfi, where you can see the magnificent castle of Frederick II Hohenstaufen of Swabia (the Constitutions of Melfi), and the Roman city of Venosa, the birthplace of the Latin poet Horace and famous for its ancient Roman thermal baths and its wine, the Aglianico del Vulture, and you will soon be convinced.
The unique composition of the volcanic soil combined with the care and with scientific, technological as well as the special attention to tradition confer to our products premium quality and distinctive taste that you will not fail to appreciate.</h4> -->
